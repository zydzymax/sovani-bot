# CI Guard: Prevent unscoped SQL queries from merging (Stage 19)
#
# This script scans all Python files for SQL queries that access business tables
# without proper org_id scoping. Fails the build if violations are found.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/ci/check_org_scope.sh
#
# Returns:
#   0 - All checks passed
#   1 - Found unscoped queries or other violations
